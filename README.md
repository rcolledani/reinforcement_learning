Reinforcement Learning Projects

1- Bandits : The aim of this project was to simulte a Bandit problem using different decision rule : greedy, epsilon-greedy, UCB, Thompson and visualize the simulation regarding the different parameters.

2- Value_function : The aim of this project was to determine the optimal value fonction on the Perudo game using : Monte Carlo, SARSA, and Q-learning

3- Optimal_strategy : The aim of this project was to implement a basic optimal strategy computation.
